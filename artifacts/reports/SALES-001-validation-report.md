## Recommendations

While both deliverables are complete and meet all KPIs, the following enhancements could be considered for future iterations:

1. **Pitch Deck Design**: Create actual slide deck in Figma/Canva based on outline (noted in pitch-deck-outline.md footer)
2. **One-Pager PDF**: Design formatted PDF version for distribution (currently markdown)
3. **Demo Flow**: Create accompanying demo script aligned with pitch deck slides
4. **Persona Variants**: Create 4 separate one-pager variants optimized for each persona
5. **Customer Quotes**: Add testimonials once pilot customers provide feedback
6. **ROI Calculator**: Add simple calculator to quantify time savings (50% reduction = X hours/week)

**Priority**: LOW - These are enhancements, not blockers. Current deliverables are production-ready.
