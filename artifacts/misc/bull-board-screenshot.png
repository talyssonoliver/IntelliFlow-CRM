import { configureBullBoardForExpress } from '@intelliflow/platform/queues';

const serverAdapter = new ExpressAdapter();
configureBullBoardForExpress(serverAdapter, {
  basePath: '/admin/queues',

});

app.use('/admin/queues', serverAdapter.getRouter());

with Redis and Bull Board properly configured.
