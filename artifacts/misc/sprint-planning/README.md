# Sprint planning artifacts (Sprint 0)

This directory tracks Sprint 0 planning outputs for **ENV-018-AI**.

## Sprint 0 scope

- Capture a baseline velocity/capacity model and risk register placeholders.
- Provide templates that can be replaced with real outputs once delivery metrics
  are flowing in CI.

## Deferred scope

AI-driven velocity prediction and automated risk detection are planned for
later sprints (see `artifacts/debt-ledger.*` origin_task=ENV-018-AI).
