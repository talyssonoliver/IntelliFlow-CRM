+SPRINT 0 COMPLIANCE REPORT (PLACEHOLDER)
+========================================
+
+Task: ENV-013-AI - Automated Security Implementation
+Generated: 2025-12-19
+
+This is a placeholder artifact committed to track Sprint 0 requirements.
+Replace with a real PDF export after running compliance checks and generating
+evidence packs (SOC2/GDPR/ISO) in later sprints.
+
+Contents to include when replacing:
+- Scope (systems, environments)
+- Applicable controls/frameworks
+- Evidence references (scan results, configs, logs)
+- Exceptions and accepted risks
+- Sign-off

+# Security (Sprint 0)
+
+This folder captures Sprint 0 security deliverables for IntelliFlow CRM.
+
+## What exists in Sprint 0
+
+- CI security workflows and baseline thresholds (see `.github/workflows/security.yml`).
+- Repository-level security policy (`SECURITY.md`).
+- Configuration stubs and artifact tracking for:
+  - scan results (`artifacts/misc/security-scan-results.json`)
+  - compliance report placeholder (`artifacts/reports/compliance-report.pdf`)
+  - applied patch log (`artifacts/logs/patch-log.csv`)
+
+## What is intentionally deferred
+
+Sprint 0 focuses on establishing security guardrails and repeatable checks.
+Advanced items (full compliance evidence packs, automated remediation, SOC2/GDPR
+audits) are tracked in `artifacts/debt-ledger.*` and are expected to land in
+later sprints.
+
+## Operator notes (manual verification)
+
+- Review `.github/workflows/security.yml` for enabled scanners and thresholds.
+- Ensure secret scanning is enabled at the Git hosting layer (GitHub Advanced
+  Security) and that team access is configured appropriately.
+- Replace placeholder artifacts with real scan outputs once CI is running.
