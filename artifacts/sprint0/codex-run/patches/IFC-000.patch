+# ADR-000: IntelliFlow CRM Feasibility Assessment
+
+**Status:** Proposed
+
+**Date:** 2025-12-19
+
+**Deciders:** CEO, CTO, CFO
+
+**Technical Story:** IFC-000
+
+## Context and Problem Statement
+
+IntelliFlow CRM aims to deliver a modern CRM with AI-first workflow automation.
+Before committing significant investment, the leadership team needs a clear
+go/no-go decision supported by a lightweight business case and risk assessment.
+
+## Decision Drivers
+
+- Time-to-value: deliver a working MVP quickly without overbuilding.
+- Cost control: prevent runaway AI/API and infrastructure costs.
+- Security and privacy: minimize risk and comply with baseline obligations.
+- Maintainability: keep engineering velocity high with strong foundations.
+
+## Considered Options
+
+- **Option A: Build IntelliFlow CRM as planned (AI-first, monorepo)**
+- **Option B: Build CRM without AI initially, add AI later**
+- **Option C: Buy/off-the-shelf CRM and build only AI add-ons**
+
+## Decision Outcome
+
+Chosen option: **Option A (proceed)**, because the Sprint 0 foundations enable
+rapid iteration, keep the architecture cohesive, and allow early measurement of
+AI impact while controlling risk via feature flags, observability, and security
+guardrails.
+
+### Positive Consequences
+
+- Single cohesive platform and developer experience (monorepo + shared packages).
+- Early instrumentation and governance make AI impact measurable.
+- Feature flags allow controlled release and rapid rollback.
+
+### Negative Consequences
+
+- Higher early engineering investment vs buying a CRM.
+- AI features introduce additional security/privacy and cost concerns.
+
+## Links

+- Placeholder business case: `artifacts/reports/business-case.pdf`
+- Placeholder SWOT: `artifacts/reports/swot-analysis.xlsx`
+- Placeholder financial model: `artifacts/reports/financial-model.xlsx`
+
+## Validation Criteria
+
+- [ ] Business case reviewed and signed by CEO/CFO
+- [ ] Risks documented and owned
+- [ ] Budget and timeline approved
