+# Sprint Data Consistency Guide
+
+## Overview
+
+The IntelliFlow CRM project uses **Sprint_plan.csv** as the **Single Source of Truth** for all task data. This guide explains how to maintain data consistency and prevent synchronization issues.
+
+## Validation Systems (Two Systems, Two Purposes)
+
+We have **2 validation systems** that work together:
+
+1. **`validation.yaml`** - Task completion validation (used by orchestrator)
+   - **Purpose:** Determines if a task is actually DONE
+   - **Validates:** Artifacts exist, commands succeed, criteria met
+   - **Used by:** `orchestrator.sh` automation
+   - **Example:** "ENV-001-AI is done when monorepo structure exists and builds pass"
+
+2. **`sprint0-validation.ts`** - Infrastructure validation
+   - **Purpose:** Confirms development environment is ready
+   - **Validates:** Files, configs, tools, directories exist
+   - **Used by:** `pnpm run validate:sprint0`
+   - **Example:** "Check .eslintrc.js exists, Docker running, TypeScript configured"
+
+**Note:** Data consistency (CSV Ôåö JSON sync) is automatically validated by `sync-metrics.ts` - no separate script needed!
+
+## Architecture
+
+```
+Sprint_plan.csv (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
+    Ôåô (sync)
+    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ Sprint_plan.json (derived)
+    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ task-registry.json (derived)
+    Ôö£ÔöÇÔöÇ sprint-0/_summary.json (derived)
+    ÔööÔöÇÔöÇ sprint-0/**/*.json (derived task files)
+```
+
+## Status Values
+
+**Allowed CSV Status Values:**
+- `Done` / `Completed` ÔåÆ JSON: `DONE`
+- `In Progress` ÔåÆ JSON: `IN_PROGRESS`
+- `Blocked` ÔåÆ JSON: `BLOCKED`
+- `Planned` ÔåÆ JSON: `PLANNED`
+- `Backlog` ÔåÆ JSON: `BACKLOG`
+
+ÔÜá´©Å **Any other status value will cause validation errors!**
+
+## Workflows
+
+### 1. Updating Task Status (Correct Way)
+
+```bash
+# Step 1: Edit the CSV file
+# Edit apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/_global/Sprint_plan.csv
+# Change Status column to one of: Done, In Progress, Blocked, Planned, Backlog
+
+# Step 2: Sync all derived files (includes automatic validation)
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+
+# Step 3: Commit if sync succeeds
+git add apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/
+git commit -m "update: Sprint 0 task statuses"
+```
+
+### 2. Before Committing Sprint Changes
+
+```bash
+# Sync will automatically validate data consistency
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+
+# If you see warnings about orphaned files, delete them or add to CSV
+# If you see errors, fix the CSV and run sync again
+```
+
+### 3. Recovering from Inconsistent Data
+
+```bash
+# If you have inconsistent data between CSV and JSON files:
+
+# 1. Re-sync from CSV (includes validation)
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+
+# 2. Review changes
+git diff apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/
+
+# 3. Commit synchronized data
+git add apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/
+git commit -m "fix: synchronize Sprint metrics from CSV"
+```
+
+## Common Issues & Solutions
+
+### Issue 1: Status Mismatch
+
+**Error:** `Task ENV-XXX: Status mismatch - CSV: "Backlog" ÔåÆ JSON should be: "BACKLOG" but got: "PLANNED"`
+
+**Cause:** JSON files were updated manually or sync script had a bug.
+
+**Solution:**
+```bash
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+```
+
+### Issue 2: Count Mismatch
+
+**Error:** `_summary.json total (25) doesn't match CSV (27)`
+
+**Cause:** _summary.json was updated manually or tasks were added/removed from CSV.
+
+**Solution:**
+```bash
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+```
+
+### Issue 3: Invalid Status Value
+
+**Error:** `Task ENV-XXX: Invalid status "Work In Progress". Allowed: Done, Completed, In Progress, Blocked, Planned, Backlog`
+
+**Cause:** Typo or non-standard status value in CSV.
+
+**Solution:**
+1. Open `apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/_global/Sprint_plan.csv`
+2. Find the task with invalid status
+3. Change to one of the allowed values
+4. Run `pnpm run sync:metrics`
+
+### Issue 4: Missing JSON File
+
+**Error:** `Missing JSON file for Sprint 0 task: ENV-XXX`
+
+**Cause:** Task was added to CSV but JSON file wasn't created.
+
+**Solution:**
+```bash
+# Create the missing file manually or run:
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+```
+
+### Issue 5: Orphaned JSON File
+
+**Warning:** `Orphaned JSON file: .../ENV-XXX.json (task ENV-XXX not in CSV or not Sprint 0)`
+
+**Cause:** Task was removed from CSV or moved to different sprint, but JSON file remains.
+
+**Solution:**
+1. Verify task should be removed
+2. Delete the orphaned JSON file
+3. Or update CSV to include the task if it was accidentally removed
+
+## Automation Safeguards
+
+### Automatic Validation in Sync
+
+The `sync-metrics.ts` script automatically validates data after syncing:
+- Detects orphaned JSON files (not in CSV)
+- Warns about inconsistencies
+- Fails if critical errors found
+- No separate validation command needed!
+
+## Best Practices
+
+### Ô£à DO
+
+- Always edit `Sprint_plan.csv` first
+- Run `sync:metrics` after CSV changes
+- Run `validate:sprint-data` before committing
+- Use exact status values (case-sensitive)
+- Keep CSV as single source of truth
+
+### ÔØî DON'T
+
+- Manually edit JSON files in `sprint-0/`
+- Edit `_summary.json` manually
+- Edit `task-registry.json` manually
+- Use custom status values
+- Commit without validation
+
+## Sync Script Details
+
+**Location:** `apps/project-tracker/scripts/sync-metrics.ts`
+
+**What it does:**
+1. Syncs all JSON files from CSV (Single Source of Truth)
+2. Automatically validates data consistency
+3. Detects orphaned files (warns but doesn't fail)
+4. Updates task-registry.json, _summary.json, phase summaries
+
+**Exit Codes:**
+- `0`: Sync and validation passed
+- `1`: Sync or validation failed
+
+## Scripts Reference
+
+| Script | Purpose | When to Use |
+|--------|---------|-------------|
+| `pnpm run sync:metrics` | Sync all JSON files from CSV + validate | After editing CSV (always!) |
+| `pnpm run validate:sprint0` | Validate infrastructure setup | Environment checks |
+| `./orchestrator.sh validate TASK-ID` | Check if task is DONE | Task completion checks |

+### Sync script fails
+
+```bash
+# Check if running from correct directory
+cd apps/project-tracker
+npx tsx scripts/sync-metrics.ts
+
+# Or use root command
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+```
+
+### Validation script fails
+
+```bash
+# Run with verbose output
+tsx tools/scripts/validate-sprint-data.ts
+
+# Check specific issues
+pnpm run validate:sprint-data
+```
+
+### Pre-commit hook blocked my commit
+
+```bash
+# Fix the issues
+pnpm run sync:metrics
+pnpm run validate:sprint-data
+
+# Try commit again
+git commit -m "your message"
+```
+
+## Support
+
+If you encounter issues not covered here:
+
+1. Check recent changes: `git log apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/`
+2. Review validation output carefully
+3. Ensure you're using allowed status values
+4. Run sync script and validate again
+5. Check this documentation for updates
+
+## Version History

+- **v1.0** (2025-12-15): Initial data consistency framework
+  - Added BACKLOG status support
+  - Created validation script
+  - Added CI workflow
