## Agent Orchestration Instructions

### How to Execute This Sprint

This sprint should be executed using Claude Code with sub-agent orchestration. Follow these patterns:

### 0. Pre-Execution Context (CRITICAL)

**Before starting any task, gather context from previous work:**

```bash
# 1. Read completed tasks from previous sprint(s) for context
cat apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/sprint-1/_summary.json

# 2. Review dependency graph to understand task relationships
cat apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/_global/dependency-graph.json

# 3. Check current sprint status
cat apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/_global/Sprint_plan.csv | grep "Sprint 2"

# 4. Review any existing specs/plans from dependencies
ls -la artifacts/specs/
ls -la artifacts/plans/
```

**Key Files to Read for Context:**
- `apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/_global/Sprint_plan.csv` - Full task registry
- `apps/project-tracker/docs/metrics/sprint-*/` - Previous sprint evidence
- `artifacts/attestations/<TASK_ID>/` - Task attestations (schema: `attestation.schema.json`)
- `docs/architecture/` - Architecture decisions and patterns

**Attestation Structure** (`artifacts/attestations/<TASK_ID>/`):
- `attestation.json` - Completion evidence with verdict, KPIs, validations
- `context_pack.md` - Prerequisites (files read before starting)
- `context_pack.manifest.json` - SHA256 hashes of prerequisite files
- `plan.md` / `spec.md` - Task planning documents (if applicable)

### 1. Task Lifecycle Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Every task must follow this lifecycle:

```
Backlog → Planned → In Progress → Done
```

**For each task, execute these steps in order:**

#### Step 1: Plan the Task (Backlog → Planned)
```bash
# Create task specification
mkdir -p artifacts/specs/<TASK_ID>
# Write spec file with:
# - Objective and scope
# - Technical approach
# - Files to create/modify
# - Test strategy
# - Acceptance criteria

# Update CSV status to "Planned"
# The system will auto-update via MATOP/SWARM, or manually:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/tasks/<TASK_ID>/plan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "Planned", "specPath": "artifacts/specs/<TASK_ID>/spec.md"}'
```

#### Step 2: Start Implementation (Planned → In Progress)
```bash
# Update status to "In Progress"
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/tasks/<TASK_ID>/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "In Progress"}'

# Execute via SWARM or MATOP (see sections below)
```

#### Step 3: Complete & Validate (In Progress → Done)
```bash
# Run validation and audit (see Section 8)
# Update status to "Done" with evidence
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/tasks/<TASK_ID>/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "Done", "evidencePath": "artifacts/stoa-runs/<TASK_ID>/"}'
```

### 2. Parallel Task Spawning

For parallel phases, spawn sub-agents using the `Task` tool:

```bash
# Sprint 2 parallel execution:
# No parallel tasks in this sprint
```

The `&` suffix indicates parallel execution. Wait for all to complete before proceeding to the next phase.

### 3. SWARM Execution (Implementation Tasks)

For **implementation tasks** (0 tasks marked as `swarm`):

```bash
# Run via SWARM 5-phase pipeline
./scripts/swarm/orchestrator.sh run-quick <TASK_ID>
```

**SWARM Pipeline Phases:**
1. **Architect** - Generate spec/plan via MCP → Creates `artifacts/specs/<TASK_ID>/`
2. **Enforcer** - Generate tests (TDD) → Creates test files first
3. **Builder** - Implement code → Makes tests pass
4. **Gatekeeper** - Run quality gates (typecheck, lint, test)
5. **Auditor** - Logic & security review → Creates attestation

**Before SWARM execution, the agent MUST:**
1. Read the task's pre-requisites from Sprint_plan.csv
2. Read any dependent task's evidence/output
3. Create a spec in `artifacts/specs/<TASK_ID>/spec.md`
4. Update status to "Planned" before starting

**SWARM Tasks in this Sprint:**
- None

### 4. MATOP Execution (Validation Tasks)

For **validation tasks** (0 tasks marked as `matop`):

```bash
# Run via MATOP unified orchestrator
pnpm matop <TASK_ID>
# or
npx tsx tools/stoa/matop-execute.ts <TASK_ID>
```

**MATOP STOA Gates:**
- **Foundation** - TypeCheck, Build, Test coverage, ESLint, Prettier
- **Security** - Gitleaks, pnpm audit, Snyk, Semgrep, Trivy
- **Quality** - Test coverage enforcement
- **Domain** - Dependency validation, business logic tests
- **Intelligence** - AI component tests
- **Automation** - CI/CD pipeline validation

**Before MATOP execution, the agent MUST:**
1. Verify all dependencies are completed (check attestations)
2. Read the task definition from Sprint_plan.csv
3. Update status to "In Progress" before running gates

**MATOP Tasks in this Sprint:**
- None

### 5. Manual Tasks

These tasks require human intervention (0 tasks):

- None

### 6. Status Updates

**Task Status Lifecycle:**
| Status | Meaning | Trigger |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Backlog | Not started | Initial state |
| Planned | Spec created, ready to start | After spec/plan created |
| In Progress | Currently being worked on | After starting execution |
| Done | Completed and validated | After audit passes |
| Blocked | Waiting on dependency/issue | When blocker identified |

**Automatic Updates:**
After completing each task, the system will automatically:
1. Update `Sprint_plan.csv` status to "Done"
2. Generate evidence in `artifacts/stoa-runs/` or `artifacts/swarm-runs/`
3. Create attestation in `artifacts/attestations/<TASK_ID>/attestation.json` with:
   - `$schema`: `https://intelliflow-crm.com/schemas/attestation.schema.json`
   - `schema_version`: `"1.0.0"`
   - `verdict`: `"COMPLETE"` or `"INCOMPLETE"`
   - `context_acknowledgment`: files_read with SHA256 hashes
   - `kpi_results`: target vs actual for each KPI
   - `definition_of_done_items`: criteria with met/evidence
4. Update phase summaries

**Manual status updates:**
```bash
# Update via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/sprint/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"runId": "<RUN_ID>", "update": {"type": "task_complete", "taskId": "<TASK_ID>"}}'
```

### 7. Error Handling

If a task fails:
1. Check `artifacts/blockers.json` for blocker details
2. Check `artifacts/human-intervention-required.json` for escalations
3. Review remediation report in evidence directory
4. Fix issues and re-run the task

### 8. Final Audit & Validation (CRITICAL)

**Before marking any task as Done, run the full audit:**

```bash
# Run comprehensive audit for the task
pnpm turbo typecheck --filter=...
pnpm turbo lint --filter=...
pnpm turbo test --filter=...

# Or run the full audit matrix
npx tsx tools/stoa/run-stoa.ts --task-id <TASK_ID> --gates foundation,security,quality

# Verify all gates pass
cat artifacts/stoa-runs/<TASK_ID>/summary.json | jq '.verdict'
```

**Required Gates for Sprint Completion:**
| Gate | Command | Pass Criteria |
|------|---------|---------------|
| TypeCheck | `pnpm turbo typecheck` | Exit code 0 |
| Lint | `pnpm turbo lint` | 0 warnings |
| Test | `pnpm turbo test` | Coverage ≥90% |
| Gitleaks | `gitleaks detect` | No secrets found |
| Build | `pnpm turbo build` | Exit code 0 |

**Sprint-Level Audit:**
```bash
# Before declaring sprint complete, run full audit
pnpm audit:sprint 2

# Generate attestation report
npx tsx tools/scripts/attest-sprint.ts 2

# Verify all tasks pass
cat artifacts/reports/attestation/sprint-2-latest.json
```

### 9. Project Tracker Dashboard Workflow

**Use the Project Tracker Dashboard (http://localhost:3002) to monitor and validate progress:**

| View | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Sprint overview, task counts, progress bars | Start of sprint, quick status checks |
| **Kanban** | Visual task board by status | Track task flow: Backlog → Planned → In Progress → Done |
| **Analytics** | Charts, trends, velocity metrics | Mid-sprint reviews, identify bottlenecks |
| **Metrics** | KPI tracking, phase summaries, evidence | Verify KPIs met, check attestations |
| **Execution** | Sprint orchestration, parallel spawning | Execute sprints, monitor sub-agents |
| **Governance** | Policy compliance, STOA gate results | Verify governance requirements met |
| **Contracts** | Task agreements, SLAs, commitments | Review task contracts before completion |
| **Audit** | Full audit runs, security scans, quality gates | Final validation before marking Done |

**Workflow Integration:**

1. **Before Starting a Task:**
   - Check **Dashboard** for overall sprint status
   - Review **Kanban** to see task dependencies and blockers
   - Check **Governance** for any policy requirements

2. **During Task Execution:**
   - Monitor **Execution** view for sub-agent status
   - Check **Metrics** for real-time KPI tracking
   - Review **Analytics** for velocity and progress

3. **Before Completing a Task:**
   - Run **Audit** view to execute all quality gates
   - Verify **Governance** compliance passes
   - Check **Contracts** view for task acceptance criteria
   - Confirm **Metrics** show KPIs met

4. **API Endpoints for Dashboard:**
```bash
# Dashboard data
curl http://localhost:3002/api/sprint-plan

# Metrics & KPIs
curl http://localhost:3002/api/metrics/sprint?sprint=2

# Governance status
curl http://localhost:3002/api/governance/summary?sprint=2

# Audit results
curl http://localhost:3002/api/audit/stream

# Execution status
curl http://localhost:3002/api/sprint/status?runId=<RUN_ID>
```
