# Event Taxonomy

## Principles

- Events are consistent, documented, and versioned
- Each event has required properties and a clear purpose

## Core Events (Initial)

- `account_created`
- `account_updated`
- `opportunity_created`
- `opportunity_stage_changed`
- `task_created`
- `task_completed`

## Required Properties

- `event_id`
- `timestamp`
- `actor_id`
- `entity_type`
- `entity_id`
