### Email Templates

#### Day 0: Initial Email
```
Subject: Quick question about [Company] case management

Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company] handles [practice area] cases - I'm curious how your team
currently tracks client intake and case deadlines?

Many firms like yours find their teams spending 40%+ of time on administrative
tasks rather than billable work.

We've helped firms like [Similar Firm] reduce admin overhead by 60% while
improving deadline compliance.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore if IntelliFlow could help
[Company]?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### Day 3: Follow-up Email
```
Subject: Re: Case management efficiency

Hi [First Name],

Just following up on my note from Monday.

I wanted to share a quick case study: [Similar Firm] increased their client
intake capacity by 3x without adding staff by automating their qualification
and scheduling workflow.

Is client intake and matter management something you're focused on improving
this quarter?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### Day 7: Value Add Email
```
Subject: 3 ways AI is transforming legal operations

Hi [First Name],

Thought you might find this interesting - we just published a brief guide on
how leading firms are using AI to:

1. Auto-score and qualify incoming client leads
2. Predict case outcomes and optimal pricing
3. Automate deadline tracking and court filing

[Link to resource]

Happy to discuss how any of these might apply to [Company].

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### Day 17: Breakup Email
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back - totally understand if
the timing isn't right.

I'll close your file for now, but if case management or client intake ever
becomes a priority, I'm always happy to reconnect.

All the best to you and the team at [Company].

Best,
[Your Name]
```
