```

**Set Agenda**:
```

**MEDDIC Element**: Economic Buyer (identify if they control budget)

---

### 3. Understand the Business (10 minutes)

"What tools or systems are you using today for CRM, sales engagement, and automation?"

"How many leads do you generate per month? What's your conversion rate?"

- Team maturity and sales sophistication
- Growth trajectory or scaling challenges

**MEDDIC Elements**: Metrics (current state), Decision Criteria (current tools)

---

### 4. Identify Pain (15 minutes)

This is the most critical part of the call. Use the SPIN framework (Situation, Problem, Implication, Need-Payoff).

**Situation Questions** (establish context):
```
"How do you currently manage incoming leads?"

"What's your process for lead assignment and follow-up?"

"How do you track pipeline and forecast deals?"
```

**Problem Questions** (uncover challenges):
```
"What's not working well with your current setup?"

"What are the biggest gaps or limitations you're facing?"

"Where are you losing leads or revenue in the current process?"

"What prompted you to start looking for a new solution now?"
```

**Implication Questions** (amplify the pain):
```
"What's the impact of [problem] on your revenue/team/growth?"

"How much time/money is [problem] costing you per month?"

"What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6-12 months?"

"How does this affect your ability to hit your sales targets?"
```

**Need-Payoff Questions** (envision the solution):
```
"If you could wave a magic wand and fix [problem], what would that look like?"

"What would be different if you solved this? How would your day-to-day change?"

"What would it mean for your business if you could [improve metric by X%]?"
```

**Example Pain Discovery Flow**:
```
Rep: "How do you currently handle inbound leads from your website?"
Prospect: "They go into a spreadsheet, and then we manually assign them to reps."

Rep: "Got it. What challenges are you running into with that process?"
Prospect: "It's slow. Sometimes leads sit there for hours before anyone sees them."

Rep: "How often does that happen?"
Prospect: "Probably 30-40% of our leads don't get touched same-day."

Rep: "What's the impact of that delay on your conversion rates?"
Prospect: "Hard to say exactly, but we know speed matters. We're probably losing deals."

Rep: "If I do the math - you mentioned 500 leads/month, 40% delayed, 15% conversion rate normally.
Even if half of those delayed leads are lost opportunities, that's potentially 30 deals per month.
At $10k average deal size, that's $300k in missed revenue. Does that sound about right?"
Prospect: "Yeah, that's a real problem."

Rep: "What would it be worth to your business to cut that response time from hours to minutes?"
```

**What You're Listening For**:
- Specific, quantifiable pain points
- Urgency (why now?)
- Impact of inaction (cost of doing nothing)
- Emotional engagement (frustrated, excited, desperate?)

**MEDDIC Element**: Identify Pain (core business problem)

---

### 5. Understand the Buying Process (10 minutes)

**Decision-Making Questions**:
```
"Have you purchased a CRM or similar software before? Walk me through how that process went."

"Who else needs to be involved in evaluating and deciding on a solution like this?"

"What's the typical approval process for a purchase of this size at [Company]?"

"Who ultimately signs off on a purchase like this? When can we get them involved?"
```

**Timeline Questions**:
```
"What's your timeline for making a decision?"

"What's driving that timeline? Is there a specific event or deadline?"

"What could slow down or speed up your decision process?"
```

**Budget Questions**:
```
"Have you allocated budget for this project?"

"What's your budget range for solving this problem?"

"If we can demonstrate clear ROI, is there flexibility to invest more to get the right solution?"
```

**Evaluation Criteria Questions**:
```
"What are the must-haves vs. nice-to-haves in a solution?"

"What would make you say 'yes, this is the one' vs. 'no, not the right fit'?"

"Are you evaluating other vendors? Who else are you looking at?"

"What concerns or risks do you have about changing CRM systems?"
```

**What You're Listening For**:

- Budget availability and flexibility

```
"Who internally is most excited about solving this problem?"

"If we move forward, who would be the internal advocate to help drive this?"

"What's in it for you personally if this project is successful?"

"How do you typically build consensus for new tools or initiatives?"
```

**What You're Listening For**:
- Is this person willing to champion internally?
- Do they have influence with the Economic Buyer?
- What's their personal motivation?
- Are they willing to introduce you to stakeholders?

**MEDDIC Element**: Champion (internal advocate)

### 7. Share Your Solution (5 minutes)

**Only after you've uncovered pain should you pitch.**

**Tailored Value Proposition**:
```
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like your biggest challenges are:
1. [Pain #1 - slow lead response]
2. [Pain #2 - manual processes eating rep time]
3. [Pain #3 - lack of pipeline visibility]

The good news is, this is exactly what IntelliFlow is built for.

[Share 2-3 minute overview tailored to their pains]

- AI-powered lead routing gets leads to the right rep in under 60 seconds
- Automation handles 80% of data entry and follow-up tasks
- Real-time pipeline dashboards give you full forecast visibility

Companies like [similar customer] have seen [specific results - 40% faster response, 25% higher conversion].

Does that resonate with what you're trying to achieve?"
```

**Keep It Brief**:
- Focus on their pains, not all your features
- Use metrics that matter to them
- Social proof from similar companies
- Save deep dive for demo

---

### 8. Next Steps (5 minutes)

**If Qualified** (all MEDDIC elements present or discoverable):
```
"This sounds like a great fit. Here's what I'd suggest for next steps:

1. I'll send you a quick recap email with what we discussed
2. Let's schedule a 60-minute demo where I can show you IntelliFlow in action,
   tailored to your [specific use cases]
3. Ideally, we'd want [stakeholders: sales manager, operations, IT] to join so we can
   address everyone's questions at once

Does that work? What's your calendar look like next week?"
```

**If More Information Needed**:
```
"I want to make sure I bring you the right solution. Before we move to a demo,
I'd love to connect with [Economic Buyer / IT / other stakeholder] to understand
[budget / technical requirements / approval process].

Can you make an introduction?"
```

**If Not Qualified**:
```
"Based on our conversation, it sounds like [reason - timing isn't right / you need X feature we don't have / budget constraints].

I don't want to waste your time. Would it make sense to reconnect in [3-6 months]
when [condition changes]? In the meantime, I'll send over [resource] that might be helpful."
```

**Schedule Next Meeting Before Hanging Up**:
- Never end with "I'll send you some times"
- Book the meeting while you have them
- Send calendar invite immediately after call

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't**:
- Pitch before understanding their pain
- Talk more than the prospect talks (aim for 70/30 them/you)
- Skip budget/timeline questions (feels awkward but essential)
- Accept vague answers ("we're looking to improve things")
- End without clear next steps
- Forget to identify Economic Buyer early

**Do**:
- Ask follow-up questions to get specifics
- Quantify pain with metrics whenever possible
- Listen for emotional cues (frustration, excitement, urgency)
- Take detailed notes in real-time
- Confirm next meeting before ending call
- Disqualify quickly if not a fit
