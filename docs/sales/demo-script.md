## Demo Structure

### 1. Opening (5 minutes)

**Welcome and Introductions**:
```
"Thanks everyone for joining! Before we dive in, let's do quick intros.
I'm [Name], Account Executive. With me is [SE Name], our Sales Engineer who will
walk through the technical demo.

Let's go around the room - can you share your name, role, and what you're hoping
to get out of today's demo?"
```

**What You're Listening For**:
- Who is the Economic Buyer (if present)?
- What are individual stakeholder priorities?
- Any new pain points or requirements not mentioned in discovery?

**Recap Discovery**:
```
"Great. So just to make sure we're all aligned, here's what we heard from [Discovery Contact]
in our initial conversation:

1. [Pain #1 - slow lead response costing ~$300k/year in lost deals]
2. [Pain #2 - reps spending 15 hours/week on data entry]
3. [Pain #3 - lack of real-time pipeline visibility]

Your goals are to [Goal #1], [Goal #2], and [Goal #3].

Did I get that right? Anything to add or change?"
```

**Set Agenda**:
```
"Here's what we'll cover in the next hour:

1. Quick overview of IntelliFlow's AI-powered approach [5 min]
2. Live demo focused on your three main challenges [35 min]
3. Q&A and technical deep dive as needed [15 min]
4. Next steps [5 min]

We want this to be interactive, so please jump in with questions anytime. Sound good?"
```

---

### 2. Context Setting (5 minutes)

**Brief Product Positioning** (3 slides max):

**Slide 1: The Problem**
```
"Most CRMs are data entry tools that slow your reps down. Sales teams spend 65% of their time
on non-selling activities - logging calls, updating fields, chasing down information.

Meanwhile, leads go cold, pipelines are inaccurate, and revenue is at risk."
```

**Slide 2: The IntelliFlow Approach**
```
"IntelliFlow is different. We're an AI-first CRM that automates the busywork so your reps
can focus on selling.

Our AI agents:
- Capture and route leads in under 60 seconds
- Auto-enrich contacts with 40+ data points
- Score and prioritize opportunities in real-time
- Generate personalized emails and follow-ups
- Predict deal outcomes with 85% accuracy

The result? 40% faster lead response, 25% higher conversion, and 15 hours/week back to your reps."
```

**Slide 3: Customer Proof Point**
```
[Show case study from similar company]

"[Company Name], a [similar industry] company with [similar size], faced the same challenges:
- Before IntelliFlow: 4-hour lead response, 12% conversion, manual everything
- After IntelliFlow: 8-minute response, 18% conversion, 80% automation
- Result: $1.2M incremental revenue in first year

Today, I'll show you how we can deliver similar results for [Prospect Company]."
```

**Transition to Demo**:
```
"Alright, let's see it in action. I'm going to share my screen now."
```

---

### 3. Core Demo (35 minutes)

**Important**: Follow the "Problem → Solution → Impact" structure for each section.

#### Section A: Lead Capture & Routing (10 minutes)

**Problem Recap**:
```
"You mentioned that leads from your website sit in a spreadsheet for hours before anyone
responds. Let's see how IntelliFlow solves that."
```

**Demo Flow**:

1. **Show Inbound Lead Capture**:
   ```
   [Navigate to Leads dashboard]

   "Here's a lead that just came in from our website 30 seconds ago. Watch what happens..."

   [Show real-time notification pop-up]

   "IntelliFlow immediately:
   - Captures the lead details
   - Enriches it with company data, tech stack, social profiles
   - Scores it based on fit and intent (this one is 87 - high priority)
   - Routes it to the right rep based on territory, availability, and expertise"
   ```

2. **Show AI Enrichment**:
   ```
   [Click into lead record]

   "Look at all the data we auto-populated - company size, revenue, industry, tech stack,
   recent funding, decision-makers. Your rep didn't have to Google or manually enter any of this.

   All from just an email and company name."
   ```

3. **Show Intelligent Routing**:
   ```
   [Navigate to routing rules]

   "Here's how we route leads. You can set rules like:
   - East Coast → Sarah
   - Enterprise deals → John
   - Tech companies → Maria

   And if someone is at capacity or on PTO, we automatically reassign. No leads slip through the cracks."
   ```

4. **Show Speed to Lead**:
   ```
   [Show lead response time dashboard]

   "Here's your team's performance. Average response time: 8 minutes. Top performers under 5 minutes.

   Compare that to the 4 hours you mentioned earlier. That's the difference between winning
   and losing deals."
   ```

**Impact Statement**:
```
"So to recap: Instead of leads sitting in a spreadsheet for hours, they're in a rep's hands,
fully enriched, within 60 seconds. That's how you capture 30+ deals per month you're losing today.

Make sense?"
```

**Pause for Questions**:
```
"Any questions on lead capture before we move on?"
```

---

#### Section B: AI-Powered Automation (10 minutes)

**Problem Recap**:
```
"You also mentioned your reps spend 15 hours a week on data entry and manual follow-ups.
Let's see how IntelliFlow gets that time back."
```

**Demo Flow**:

1. **Show Email Sync & Auto-Logging**:
   ```
   [Navigate to activity timeline]

   "Every email, call, and meeting is automatically logged. No manual entry required.

   [Show email thread]

   When your rep sends an email, IntelliFlow:
   - Logs it to the lead/contact
   - Tracks opens and clicks
   - Suggests next steps based on engagement"
   ```

2. **Show AI Email Generation**:
   ```
   [Click "AI Compose"]

   "Watch this. I'll ask our AI to generate a personalized follow-up email.

   [Type: 'Follow up on demo, mention their integration question']

   [Show AI-generated email]

   In 5 seconds, we have a personalized, contextual email ready to send. Your rep can edit
   if needed, or send as-is. That's 10 minutes saved per email."
   ```

3. **Show Automated Sequences**:
   ```
   [Navigate to sequences]

   "You can build entire multi-touch sequences that run on autopilot:
   - Day 1: Initial outreach
   - Day 3: Follow-up if no response
   - Day 7: Value-add content share
   - Day 14: Break-up email

   Set it and forget it. The AI personalizes each email based on the prospect's behavior."
   ```

4. **Show Smart Reminders**:
   ```
   [Show task inbox]

   "IntelliFlow monitors all your deals and proactively reminds reps:
   - 'Lead went cold, re-engage'
   - 'Contract expiring in 30 days, time to renew'
   - 'Decision-maker changed jobs, update contact'

   No more deals falling through the cracks because someone forgot to follow up."
   ```

**Impact Statement**:
```
"Bottom line: We estimate this saves each rep 15+ hours per week. That's 15 hours they can
spend selling instead of doing data entry. At $200k quota per rep, that's material revenue impact.

Questions?"
```

---

#### Section C: Pipeline Visibility & Forecasting (10 minutes)

**Problem Recap**:
```
"Finally, you mentioned lack of pipeline visibility makes forecasting a nightmare. Let's fix that."
```

**Demo Flow**:

1. **Show Real-Time Dashboard**:
   ```
   [Navigate to pipeline dashboard]

   "This is your at-a-glance view. Updated in real-time:
   - Total pipeline by stage
   - Forecast vs. quota
   - Win rate trends
   - Velocity metrics

   No more waiting for Friday reports. This is live, always."
   ```

2. **Show Deal Insights**:
   ```
   [Click into an opportunity]

   "For each deal, IntelliFlow shows:
   - Health score (red, yellow, green)
   - AI prediction: 73% likely to close this quarter
   - Risk factors: 'No activity in 14 days' - red flag
   - Next best actions: 'Re-engage Economic Buyer'

   Your managers know exactly where to coach and where to worry."
   ```

3. **Show Forecasting**:
   ```
   [Navigate to forecast view]

   "Here's your forecast broken down by rep and stage. AI-adjusted probabilities based on
   historical patterns, not just gut feel.

   [Show accuracy metrics]

   Our customers see 85% forecast accuracy on average. Compare that to the industry average of 60%."
   ```

4. **Show Customizable Reports**:
   ```
   [Navigate to reports]

   "You can build any report you need:
   - Lead source ROI
   - Rep performance
   - Stage conversion rates
   - Sales cycle length

   Export to Excel, schedule automated emails, drill down into any metric."
   ```

**Impact Statement**:
```
"So instead of flying blind, you have complete visibility into your pipeline, real-time insights,
and AI-powered predictions. That's how you hit your number with confidence.

Questions on reporting and forecasting?"
```

---

#### Section D: Integration & Workflow (5 minutes)

**Show Key Integrations**:
```
[Navigate to integrations page]

"IntelliFlow integrates with your existing tech stack:
- Email: Outlook, Gmail (two-way sync)
- Calendar: Automatic meeting logging
- Marketing: HubSpot, Marketo (lead handoff)
- Communication: Slack, Teams (notifications)
- Enrichment: ZoomInfo, Clearbit (data augmentation)

[Show specific integration they mentioned - e.g., Outlook]

Here's the Outlook integration. Every email auto-syncs. Contacts auto-create. Meetings auto-log.
Zero manual work."
```

**Show Mobile App** (if relevant):
```
[Share mobile screen or show screenshots]

"Your reps can access everything on mobile:
- Update deals on the go
- Log calls from the road
- Get real-time notifications
- View pipeline from anywhere

Sales doesn't happen at a desk anymore. IntelliFlow goes where your reps go."
```

---

### 4. Tailored Deep Dive (Optional, 5 minutes)

**If Stakeholders Have Specific Requests**:

```
"Before we move to Q&A, are there any specific workflows or features you'd like to see in more detail?"
```

**Common Deep Dive Topics**:
- Custom fields and object models (for complex orgs)
- Security and permissions (for enterprise buyers)
- API and developer tools (for technical stakeholders)
- Admin controls and configuration (for ops teams)
- Reporting and analytics (for executives)

**Keep It Brief**:
- 2-3 minutes max per deep dive
- Delegate to SE for highly technical questions
- Offer to schedule separate session if needed

---

### 5. Q&A (15 minutes)

**Open the Floor**:
```
"Alright, let's pause there. What questions do you have?"
```

**Common Questions & Responses**:

**Q: "How long does implementation take?"**
```
A: "Great question. For a team your size, we typically see:
- Week 1: Data migration and initial setup
- Week 2: User training and configuration
- Week 3: Go-live and support
- Week 4+: Optimization and advanced features

So you're up and running in 3 weeks, fully optimized in 6-8 weeks. We'll assign a dedicated
implementation manager to ensure success."
```

**Q: "What about data migration from our current CRM?"**
```
A: "We handle that. Our implementation team will:
- Audit your current data
- Clean and deduplicate
- Map fields to IntelliFlow
- Migrate in stages (test batch first)
- Validate everything before go-live

You mentioned you're on [current CRM]. We've migrated 50+ companies from there. It's a smooth process."
```

**Q: "How much does it cost?"**
```
A: "Pricing depends on team size and features. For [X users] with the capabilities we've shown,
we're typically in the range of [$Y-$Z per user/month].

But let's talk ROI first. You mentioned losing $300k/year from slow lead response, and reps
wasting 15 hours/week. If we solve even half of that, we pay for ourselves in [timeframe].

I'll send over a detailed proposal after this call so you can see exact pricing and ROI breakdown.
Does that work?"
```

**Q: "How does this compare to [Competitor]?"**
```
A: "Good question. We see a lot of companies evaluate us against [Competitor].

The main differences:
- AI: We're AI-native, they bolted it on. Our automation is far more intelligent.
- Speed: We're built for modern cloud, they're legacy architecture. We're 3x faster.
- Usability: Reps actually use IntelliFlow. [Competitor] has 40% adoption on average.

[Hand them battle card or competitive matrix]

I'll send you a detailed comparison. But honestly, the best way to know is to try it.
Would a free trial or pilot make sense?"
```

**Q: "What if we need custom features?"**
```
A: "We have a robust API and developer platform. Many customers build custom integrations
and workflows. We also have a professional services team that can build custom solutions if needed.

What specific customizations are you thinking about?"
```

**Handle Technical Questions**:
```
[Defer to SE]

"Great question. [SE Name], can you speak to that?"
```

---

### 6. Next Steps (5 minutes)

**Gauge Interest**:
```
"So, what do you think? Does IntelliFlow look like it could solve [pain #1, #2, #3]?"
```

**If Positive**:
```
"Awesome. Here's what I propose for next steps:

1. I'll send you a detailed proposal with:
   - Pricing breakdown
   - ROI analysis based on your metrics
   - Implementation timeline

2. You review internally and discuss with [Economic Buyer / other stakeholders]

3. We schedule a follow-up call next week to address any questions and discuss terms

4. If all looks good, we can have you live in 3 weeks

Does that timeline work for you? Any concerns or blockers we should address now?"
```

**If Hesitant**:
```
"I'm sensing some hesitation. What are your concerns?"

[Address objections - see Objection Handling section]

"Would it be helpful to do a free trial or pilot with a small team before committing?"
```

**If Need More Time/Stakeholders**:
```
"I understand. Who else needs to see this before a decision can be made?

Can we schedule a follow-up demo with [Economic Buyer / IT / other stakeholder] next week?

I want to make sure everyone's questions are answered before you make a decision."
```

**Book the Next Meeting**:
```
"Let's get the next meeting on the calendar while we're all here. What does next
[Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday] look like?"
```

**Send Materials**:
```
"I'll send over:
- Recording of today's demo
- Proposal with pricing and ROI
- Case study from [similar customer]
- Implementation guide
- Any other resources you'd find helpful

You should have everything by end of day. Sound good?"
```

---

### 7. Closing (1 minute)

```
"Thanks so much for your time today. I'm excited about the possibility of working together
and helping [Company] [achieve their goals].

Looking forward to our next conversation. Don't hesitate to reach out if any questions come up
in the meantime!"
```

**Confirm Action Items**:

[Recap who's doing what]

"So just to confirm:
- I'm sending proposal and case studies by EOD
- You're reviewing internally and looping in [stakeholder]

## Demo Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Customize demo to their specific use cases and pains
- ✅ Use their industry terminology and examples
- ✅ Show real data and workflows, not generic demos
- ✅ Pause frequently for questions and confirmation
- ✅ Focus on business outcomes, not just features
- ✅ Tell stories and use customer proof points
- ✅ Drive toward clear next steps before ending

**Don't**:
- ❌ Show every feature (death by demo)
- ❌ Talk for 60 minutes straight without interaction
- ❌ Dive into technical details unless asked
- ❌ Skip the "why this matters" impact statements
- ❌ Forget to ask for the next meeting
- ❌ Leave questions unanswered ("I'll get back to you")
- ❌ Assume they understood - always confirm

---

## Demo Scorecard

Rate yourself after each demo (1-5 scale):

- [ ] Did I tailor the demo to their specific pains? (1-5)
- [ ] Did I show business impact, not just features? (1-5)
- [ ] Was the demo interactive with questions/discussion? (1-5)
- [ ] Did I address all stakeholder concerns? (1-5)
- [ ] Did I handle objections effectively? (1-5)
- [ ] Did I secure clear next steps and follow-up meeting? (1-5)
- [ ] Did stakeholders seem excited and engaged? (1-5)
- [ ] Did I move the deal forward? (1-5)

**Total Score**: ____ / 40

- 35-40: Excellent demo, high win probability
- 28-34: Good, some opportunities to improve
- 20-27: Needs improvement, deal at risk
- <20: Re-evaluate approach or disqualify

---

## Technical Difficulties Backup Plan

**If Demo Environment Fails**:
1. Have pre-recorded demo video ready (narrate over it)
2. Use slides with screenshots as backup
3. Schedule technical deep dive for another day
4. Don't panic - stay professional

**Script**:
```
"Looks like we're having a technical hiccup. Rather than waste your time troubleshooting,
let me walk you through this with a pre-recorded demo, and we'll schedule a live session
for you to try it hands-on. Sound good?"
```
