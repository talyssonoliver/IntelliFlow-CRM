# Product Vision

## Problem

Teams lose time to CRM hygiene, inconsistent data entry, and manual follow-ups.
Delivery teams also struggle to keep work systems (tickets, CI, evidence)
aligned with what was actually shipped.

## Vision Statement

IntelliFlow CRM becomes the “truth layer” for customer work by combining a
modern CRM with automation and auditable governance.

## Principles

- **Automation with evidence**: automation should produce verifiable outcomes,
  not guesswork.
- **Local-first + secure by default**: safe environments and no leaked secrets.
- **Composable architecture**: clear boundaries between web, API, data, and AI.
- **Operational excellence**: observability and runbooks are first-class.

## Outcomes

- Less busywork; more time selling/supporting customers
- Higher confidence in shipped features and operational state
- Faster onboarding and consistent ways of working

## Non-Goals (Sprint 0–1)

- Full enterprise CRM feature parity
- Complex multi-tenant billing/entitlements beyond minimal needs

## Roadmap (High-Level)

- **Sprint 0**: governance + tracker + baseline platform scaffolding
- **Sprint 1**: core CRM entities + auth + first automation loop
- **Sprint 2**: analytics segmentation + workflow automation + observability
  hardening
