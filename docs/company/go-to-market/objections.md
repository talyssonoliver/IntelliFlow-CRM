# Objections & Responses

## “We already use a CRM.”

- Response: IntelliFlow CRM focuses on automation + governance with a modern
  developer-friendly stack and measurable evidence.

## “AI will hallucinate and break our process.”

- Response: Automation is gated by validations and explicit rules. Evidence is
  recorded; unsafe changes are blocked.

## “We don’t want vendor lock-in.”

- Response: The platform is built on open tooling and clear boundaries (Next.js,
  tRPC, Postgres/Supabase, OpenTelemetry).
