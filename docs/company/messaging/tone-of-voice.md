# Tone of Voice

## Brand Voice

- Clear, direct, and practical
- Confident but not hype-driven
- Evidence-based: show what was validated and how

## Writing Guidelines

- Prefer short sentences and concrete outcomes
- Avoid exaggerated claims (“magic”, “fully autonomous”) unless backed by
  evidence
- Use consistent terminology (sprint, gate, artifact, validation)

## Do / Don’t

**Do**

- “Validated via `pnpm run validate:sprint0 -- --strict`”
- “Evidence stored under `artifacts/reports/...`”

**Don’t**

- “AI guarantees perfect outcomes”
- “Everything is automatic” (unless verified)
