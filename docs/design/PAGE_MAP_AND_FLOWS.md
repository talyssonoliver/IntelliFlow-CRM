### `_layout-shell.tsx` Pattern

Seven modules use an RSC + Client component split pattern where `layout.tsx`
exports metadata (React Server Component) and delegates sidebar/provider logic
to a `_layout-shell.tsx` (`'use client'`):

| Module          | Shell File                          |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Agent Approvals | `agent-approvals/_layout-shell.tsx` |
| Billing         | `billing/_layout-shell.tsx`         |
| Calendar        | `calendar/_layout-shell.tsx`        |
| Email           | `email/_layout-shell.tsx`           |
| Governance      | `governance/_layout-shell.tsx`      |
| Notifications   | `notifications/_layout-shell.tsx`   |
| Settings        | `settings/_layout-shell.tsx`        |

### Route Group Purposes

| Group         | Purpose                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `(public)`    | Marketing pages, no auth required                 |
| `(developer)` | Developer portal pages, SUPER_ADMIN sidebar-gated |
| `(list)`      | List views with sidebar navigation                |
| `[id]`        | Dynamic detail pages                              |
| `[slug]`      | Dynamic content pages (blog, careers)             |
| `[token]`     | Token-based verification pages                    |
